                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <div id='snake'>
                <p>I'm a long time desktop applications developer, but am I going to be a good web developer? Well,
                    there
                    are some factors in my favor. First, I can sit and gnaw on a problem for <em>hours</em> until I have
                    a
                    solution. I'm still learning the
                    tools, so it's taking me longer than it should e.g. I'm using the Chrome debugger extensively, but
                    didn't know that F12 toggled full screen display. Second, I'm a tool & shortcut collector. I have a
                    full
                    tab of sites on my speed dial for
                    "Bootcamp ". Once I learn a neat trick, it sticks with me, and I never do anything the hard way a
                    3rd or
                    4th time, because by that time I know a better way. Third, I love logic and data. I'm looking
                    forward to
                    learning JavaScript, Node
                    JS, & React, to make the web <em>do</em> stuff. I expect that some of the challenges are different:
                    I
                    don't really understand 'stateless' and 'async' as concepts. I started building applications before
                    mice; PC users tabbed from field
                    to field and didn't reach the submit button until they had traversed the whole form. When the user
                    could
                    just mouse into random fields, the whole concept of validation had to be re-considered. Gotta love a
                    challenge!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>For someone used to dealing with forms, the Contact form was <strong>not</strong> an easy tab. The
                    Name
                    field inherited a border and backround-image from "element.style " that I could NOT override. The
                    Email
                    field didn't, so the form looked
                    half baked. I finally ended up with "!important ", but at least it <em>looked</em> OK. Then I
                    couldn't
                    find an input for textarea (at least not under "input ") and struggled with making a single line
                    "input
                    type="text" look like it had
                    a box and a text area. About that time, my son came by and showed me 'textarea' And then he deleted
                    all
                    of the code that I had constructed for the Name field, and nothing broke. Well, I 'm a newbie. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The Portfolio tab was fun, although harder than I thought it would be. I tried to save myself some
                    editting tasks by looking for consistently sized images. I figured Mandalas, which are circular,
                    could
                    be sized to any dimension. My search
                    for Mandala images led to adult coloring books with a wide variety of themes, but still a nice
                    consistent proportions. I'm glad that I had Saturday 's class on the CSS Grid before I tackled the
                    layout. I still had trouble getting the images
                    to wrap left, but once I got that solved with 2 images, it was easy to do them all without even
                    needing
                    rows. I also added hover, 'tool tips ', and links to the full sized images. Print some out and spend
                    some time with your crayolas!</p>
